VSV---------- Management Dashboard


This project is a comprehensive dashboard designed to manage mental health checkups, patient consultations, and clinic operational hours. It includes dynamic features such as form validation, profile management, real-time data updates, graphs for data visualization, and a section for appointment history.

Features:
CRUDE Operations:

Create: Users can update their personal profile and preferences.
Read: Users can view statistics related to mental health checkups, active consultations, and clinic operational hours.
Update: Users can update their profile details such as name, email, phone, and address.
Delete: Not explicitly implemented, but data can be cleared or reset through the form.
Active/Inactive Toggle:

Toggle functionalities are implemented to show/hide forms and manage different sections dynamically. For example, the Profile Edit Form can be shown or hidden based on the user's actions.
Additionally, there is an "active" status for user consultations and mental health checkups, which could be updated dynamically based on user actions or clinic operations.
Responsive Design:

The layout is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on mobile and desktop devices.
The stat cards, profile management, graphs, and appointment history sections all adjust their layout and sizes to fit various screen widths.
User-Friendly Interface:

The dashboard is designed to be easy to navigate with clear sections, intuitive icons, and labels.
The user interface is minimalistic, focusing on essential features for mental health management.
Interactive elements like buttons, forms, and checkboxes are prominently displayed.
Dynamic Data Visualization (Charts):

The dashboard uses dynamic graphs to visualize statistics. These graphs (line and bar charts) can display real-time data based on user inputs or backend data updates.
Users can see updates to the graphs when mental health checkup statistics or active consultations change.
Profile Management:

Users can update their personal details (name, email, phone number, address, preferences) and save changes using the "Update Profile" button.
Form validation ensures the accuracy of data entered into the profile fields (e.g., ensuring the phone number is 10 digits).
A confirmation message or updated profile info is shown once the user submits changes.
Appointment History:

Users can view past appointments and upcoming wellness sessions for mental health management.
An interactive section allows users to view detailed lists of past sessions and workshops.
Training Section:

Users can register for training sessions related to mental health awareness, stress management, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) through checkboxes.
This section features a grid layout for easy navigation.
